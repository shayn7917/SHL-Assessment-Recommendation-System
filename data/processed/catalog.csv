Early Careers and Graduate Hiring Early careers assessments help organizations identify candidates most likely to succeed in non-managerial roles such as apprentices, interns, or graduates. These assessments can measure skills, potential, and role fit. We recommend choosing scientifically-backed, reliable, and valid assessments to ensure objectivity, accuracy, and legal defensibility in hiring. The selection of assessment tools should be driven by the specific requirements and competencies of each role. For example, some skills assessments are ideal for roles where job-specific knowledge and skills are critical, while cognitive ability tests are more suited for roles requiring problem-solving and analytical thinking. Structured interviews can offer insights into a candidate's experience and cultural fit. The key to success is using a combination of these tools that aligns with outcomes critical to the role. SHL's Early Careers Solution is a pre-built package that streamline this process, ensuring that assessments are optimized to meet your hiring needs and deliver valuable insights at every stage of the talent selection process. SHL's skills assessments measure all 96 skills in our taxonomy, reporting back on a priority of skills that are most predictive of success in early careers roles. This set of skills has been identified through validation studies with thousands of organizations and insights from 45 years of experience and 45 billion data points. It depends on candidate volume, dropout concerns, and how much you want to automate interviews.

Professional Hiring Experience is often the first thing that talent acquisition professionals look for when hiring professionals. However, it does not indicate whether the individual will successfully integrate into the team and how likely they are to stay at the organization. And the evidence suggests that the idea that candidates with more experience will perform better and go on to be long-tenured employees is unfounded. The more important takeaway should be – has the candidate learned from their previous experiences? It’s vital that hiring managers evaluate how candidates have dealt with situations in the past. Often one of the reasons that employers look for candidates with experience is that they think previous jobs have helped those people build up knowledge and skills. But we’d recommend focusing on the knowledge, skills and personality traits directly rather than using experience as a proxy for these. We believe that candidates are so much more than their resume. A data-driven approach using objective measurement gives a full picture of the individual and enables you to understand their capability based on their readiness to do the job today, their fit with your organization as well as their future potential for growth and impact. We define readiness as the capability of a candidate relative to day one of a specific job role. It comprises the hard and soft skills, and the knowledge that will allow the individual to be successful against the needs of the job right away. A candidate’s potential refers to their capacity to develop into something further — and it’s an important consideration if succession planning and promotability are important. Fit refers to culture fit, company fit and team fit and its importance increases if you need to tackle turnover, drive higher engagement, or add rigor to the cultural experience of your employees. By measuring all of these three elements in an experienced hire, you’re more likely to select the individuals that will thrive in their role and stay longer at your organization. And that’s in addition to objective measurement also helping you to remove bias from the selection process and making it easier to compare candidates against each other, removing the guesswork from hiring decisions. One of the biggest challenges for HR leaders is the level of change in organizations. Roles are evolving at an unprecedented rate which means that the shelf life of some skills is shrinking as new skill requirements come to the fore. This means that the ability to assess and understand an individual’s reskilling potential has never been more crucial, as the traditional skills that once guaranteed success are no longer sufficient. Even experienced hires need to have the ability to learn and adapt to new technologies in the future. That’s why we’ve built a measure into our professional hiring solution that will give you a comprehensive view of both the individual’s critical skills needed for today and their ability and willingness to pick up new skills for the future. This foresight can be the difference between a workforce that thrives and one that becomes obsolete. With experience under their belts, candidates are likely to have a clear picture of what they want from their career and their next employer. While they will have already been more selective with their applications, you can stand out on their shortlist by building a stronger connection with the candidate throughout the hiring experience. With our hiring platform, there are two quick ways to build engagement early in the recruitment phases. Firstly, showcase your company’s mission and values through videos ",P,
